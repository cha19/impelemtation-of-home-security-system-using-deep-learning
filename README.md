# impelemtation-of-home-security-system-using-deep-learning

We proudly present our cutting-edge home security solution, a collaborative effort by a team of 4 skilled engineers. This project showcases the seamless integration of deep learning techniques into security applications, enhancing protection and peace of mind.

### Project Overview

Our primary objective was to create a real-time person detection system tailored for doorstep security. We accomplished this by harnessing the power of deep learning models to accurately identify individuals and subsequently store their facial profiles securely.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Person Detection:** Our system utilizes advanced deep learning algorithms to instantly detect individuals at the doorstep, ensuring prompt awareness of any visitor.

- **Facial Profile Capture and Storage:** Upon detection, the system captures facial profiles of individuals. These profiles are then securely stored for future reference.

- **Efficient Categorization:** Through the application of trained deep learning models, our solution effectively categorizes detected individuals into three main categories: authorized, unauthorized, and suspicious.

- **Database Integration:** The categorized records are seamlessly integrated into a database assigned by the owner. This ensures organized storage and easy retrieval of historical data.

### Benefits

The functionality we've developed in this project offers a valuable resource, particularly in law enforcement scenarios:

- **Advanced Face Recognition:** By employing sophisticated face recognition algorithms, our solution aids law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects more effectively.

- **Streamlined Investigation:** The availability of categorized records expedites the investigative process, making it easier to track and analyze individuals' activities over time.

### Tech Stack

Our project is built upon a robust tech stack, encompassing a range of tools and frameworks:

- **OpenCV:** For computer vision tasks, including real-time video processing and facial analysis.
- **NumPy:** Facilitating efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pickle:** For serializing and deserializing Python objects, ensuring seamless data storage.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Providing an interactive environment for code development and experimentation.
- **Raspberry Pi (RPI):** Powering the hardware aspect of our solution, enabling seamless integration into existing home setups.

We are excited to share our achievements with the community and hope our work inspires others to explore the potential of deep learning in bolstering security applications. Feel free to reach out to us for further details or collaboration opportunities!
